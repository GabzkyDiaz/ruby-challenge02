Optimizing for speed can involve techniques like memoization to avoid recalculating values or using bitwise operations for exponentiation,
which can be faster than using the ** operator.

For readability, we could refactor the code to use more descriptive variable names and potentially break down complex expressions into
smaller, more manageable parts.

In this version:

We use bitwise left shift (<<) instead of 2** for exponentiation in the square method, which can be faster.
We use more descriptive method and variable names to improve readability.
We maintain the simplicity of the code structure.
These changes should improve both speed and readability. The code is now more efficient while remaining easy to understand.

Reflecting on this experiment, it's apparent that optimizations can sometimes improve both the performance and readability of code.
In this case, the optimizations were relatively straightforward and didn't significantly impact readability. However, in more complex
situations, striking the right balance between speed and readability may require more careful consideration. Overall, the exercise
provided an opportunity to explore different aspects of code quality and efficiency.
